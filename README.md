In this repository, I had made two backend projects one is connected to your local pc and other is connected to the database phpMyAdmin.
In To_Do_List.py, I had created a notepad sort of GUI where it will automatically create a new txt file in your pc and whatever you write in the notepad 
will get saved to the txt file.
In Registration_Portal.py, I had created an interactive registration portal for the new bus drivers, where the datas entered by them will get saved in my database
after successful OTP verification which will be again generated and verified by the system itself. After registration, they will be provided a unique id for future 
reference from the system itself. Additionally, there will be a login portal for the existing bus drivers where they can login by their id, password and further can 
update or deleted their credentials from the database.
